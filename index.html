                            At McDonald’s, I’d be able to contribute a lot of relevant skills to your team. I know that a big part of working at McDonald’s is being adaptable to new situations, whether it be filling in for a colleague who is unwell, or taking over a new role. From my time spent at ... I had to do extra hours to compensate for colleagues running late and work days with short notice, I also had to switch to varying roles depending on shop demands. Hence, I think I’m well prepared to respond actively and positively towards new situations.

                            I already have experience working with teams from ... and working at ..., and I think what’s most important when working in a team is communication and making sure that everyone listens to criticism as I believe everyone can learn and develop their skills. I enjoy working with a diverse team as I know everyone can contribute to the team in a different way.

                            I know that working at McDonald’s can be repetitive at times, when working at ... I found it quite repetitive but I also enjoyed that there were many different roles that I had to do. I don’t mind McDonald’s being repetitive as it will not only give me the opportunity to learn new skills but also allow me to understand new roles and the inner-workings of McDonald’s.

                            Due to high demand, I know McDonald’s can get very busy at times requiring staff to work much harder to get orders out to people as soon as possible. As a cyclist, I know what hard work feels like and I have developed stamina and determination from cycling 100Miles in a day. Although ... isn’t as busy as McDonald’s, I did have to work peak hours at times, and I find that keeping calm and collected is the best thing to do whilst under pressure and of course being as efficient as possible will help get the orders done in order to maintain customer satisfaction.
